### DynamoBundle
**Dynamo Bundle** is a collection of two small UI Revit enhancements:
- Purge Imported Line Patterns
- Purge Imported DWG Symbols

The collection has been created as part of a Dynamo User Group talk on the subject of "Dynamo, Macros and Add-Ins" which demostrates the benefit of the different ways to communicate with the **Revit API** based on recreating the process of Purging Imported DWG Symbols.

The plugin can be dowloaded and used for free.
